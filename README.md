## Help U

A React based web app that provides additional resource links for students that I am TAing for in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

### 'Reason for Development'

Durring a part-time cohort for the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, the majority of our communication with students is done using Slack, which has a post limit for each channel. Durring my experience taking the coding bootcamp as a student I realized a bit too late that I wished I had kept all of the helpful links sent from other students and from the Instructors and TA's I had. Going through the bootcamp as a TA I felt the need to help my students with these same helpful links I used and had managed to save. As a solution I have been keeping all links shared on the slack channels and first helped provide them in one location on a google docs file, but a better format seemed to be inevitable, hence this web app.
